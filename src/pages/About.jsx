                        <p className='lg:py-5 text-[12px] lg:text-[15px]'>Welcome to Epic Media ‚Äî where creativity meets storytelling, and every frame speaks louder than words.
                            We are not just a photography and filmmaking brand ‚Äî we are visual storytellers who believe in the power of moments. Founded out of sheer passion for art and cinematic expression, Epic Media was created to transform ordinary memories into extraordinary visual experiences. Through the lens of our cameras, we capture not just images, but the emotion, energy, and essence behind each story.
                            Whether it's a couple‚Äôs first glance on their wedding day, the raw beauty of a remote Himalayan village, or the behind-the-scenes chaos of a music video shoot ‚Äî we are there, preserving the moments that matter.</p>

                        <p className='lg:py-5 text-[12px] lg:text-[15px]'>The journey of Epic Media began with a simple idea: to share stories that are powerful, emotional, and visually stunning. What started as a small YouTube channel has evolved into a full-scale creative production house specializing in photography, cinematography, and digital storytelling.
                            We began by documenting our travel adventures across Kashmir, Himachal, Spiti, and many hidden gems of India. Along the way, we discovered a deeper purpose ‚Äî creating visuals that connect people to places, emotions, and each other.
                            Over the years, Epic Media has grown not just in team and equipment, but in vision. We‚Äôve worked with couples, artists, creators, and brands, helping them bring their unique stories to life through our lens. Today, we‚Äôre proud to be a one-stop creative hub for cinematic weddings, travel films, music videos, short films, and more.
